### Customer_Churn: Here is a task
- Create a dashboard using the defined KPIs for Customer Retention to reflect customer demographics and insights.
- Write email to Retention manager to report and give suggestions

### This is some challenges

- This is the one-month result; that's why I can't compare the trend of Customer churn and all of my viewpoint is applied for this month only.
- Most of your customers are young or middle-aged and independent.
- Within more than 7000 customers, 10 tenures are a period for customers to try and experience service, then they drop from your customer lists;
- Customer Churn Rate (CCR) equals 26.5%, a very high rate for a Telecom Company with a 2.9M loss from customer churn. Customers with less than 6 months contribute to the most churn customers while they did not spend much money on our service. The drop in customers over 2 years contributed to the significant revenue loss this month.


###Let's go into detail. 

- Many customers are using electronic checks, and it is noticeable that customers with 1 tenure churned more than half. You might check with the payment team to ensure that the payment process is smooth and supportive to users.
- Customers with a month-to-month contract contribute to the major churn of your company, while one-year and two-year contracts bring sustainable revenue to a company. Therefore, the sales team should focus on month-to-month customers to convert them to long-term contracts, or the promotion team can give discounts/promotions to valuable customers.
- More tech tickets are generated than admin tickets. The company should go into detail ticket management and technical review to ensure customer experience.
